# ios-hosts
This is for usage with the iOS application, "AdBlock", which allows user's to import a hosts file for DNS blocking via a local proxy. The issue with using popular hosts files is that they contain comments which are not parsed properly, so this repository contains StevenBlack's hosts file with all comments removed. Note that the default list is used.
